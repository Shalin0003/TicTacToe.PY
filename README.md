## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (either X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
5. Both players will take turns entering their moves.
